## <span style="color:#c00000">Branches</span> 

> A branch is essentially a unique set of code changes with a unique name. Each repository can have one or more branches. The main branch - the one where all changes eventually get merged back into, and is called master.

## <span style="color:#c00000">Merge</span> 
> We can merge branches with help of git merge or git rebase command.
> The main difference is that the "merge" command does merge in one commit and "rebase" copies the full commits story while merging.

### <span style="color:#c00000">Rebase use</span> 

><span style="color:#ffff00">After the rebase is completed, Git creates new commits with new ids, then permanently deletes the old commits</span>. If other users are working on branches that came from the deleted commits, they canâ€™t push their changes back to their origin.
